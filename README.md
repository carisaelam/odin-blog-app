# Blog App

This is a basic blog application built with Ruby on Rails as part of The Odin Project curriculum. Itâ€™s my first ever Rails app, and I expanded a bit beyond the assignment by adding some custom styling to enhance the user experience. The app allows you to create, edit, and delete blog posts and add comments. 

## Running the App

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blog-app.git
   cd blog-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```

3. **Set up the database:**

   ```bash
   rails db:create
   rails db:migrate
   ```

4. **Start the server:**

   ```bash
   rails server
   ```

   Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to use the app.
